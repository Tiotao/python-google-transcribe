This simple python file will take the name of a FLAC encoded file at 16000Hz, upload it to Google's Speech API servers and print the return transcription.

This uses the API built into chrome, and thus there's no way of knowing when it will stop working. It does work as of November 2013.

It is released to the Public Domain.
